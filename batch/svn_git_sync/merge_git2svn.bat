# Merge changes from Github trunk into svn
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Now going the other direction. This is a bit more 
# complicated than pulling in from svn, but make 
# sure you follow all the steps or you will get 
# nasty errors with the sync. Keep in mind the 
# –no-ff on the merge is very important to include. 
# We also want to make sure everything is fully updated from 
# both Github and the svn server before performing the push to svn.
